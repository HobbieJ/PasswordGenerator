# GenPass Alpha

## A pet-project by LinkChef

I really wanted to create a password generator as sort of a test for my abilities that I learned in coding.  However, I had
put it off for a while without commenting the code, and I had no clue where to begin when I came back.  But, I have added
a seperate class, the Math.Numerics class, so that I may return to it someday and finish it.  Until then, I'm putting the code
here for public use to see what I've been doing with it.

**Enjoy!**
