# GenPass Beta

A High School Pet Project

This program's intent is to randomly generate a password using the random function within the .NET Framework. Future goals include adding encryption so that passwords can later be saved to text files.

This is a proof of concept and a test bed, and **should not** be used for actual password management. If you desire a quality password manager, I cannot reccomend [1Password](https://1password.com) enough. They are a fantastic company, and some of the most respected people in the business.
