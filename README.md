An amazingly user friendly password generator!

This program was first made as a fun project I kept up in High School. I occasionally add new features to it, but it's not in active development.

**NOTE: This is a pet project I made to practice using C# in High School. I strongly recommend you use a full password manager to save your passwords in an encrypted file, so that you don't have to remember them, and they are safe. My password manager of choice is [1Password](https://1password.com/), however if you're looking for a free and open source solution, [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) is an amazing solution.**

## Installation
**NOTE:** This requires the .NET Framework to run. If you use the [installer](https://github.com/HobbieJ/PasswordGenerator/releases), it will automatically install!

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/HobbieJ/PasswordGenerator/releases) page, download the .MSI, and run!

## Development

Download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) *for Windows*, clone the project, and run the Solution (.SLN) file.

You'll also need to install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) in order to work with the VS_Setup project.
